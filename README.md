## What is this ?
Me trying out the Godot engine and learning C# at the same time.  
The code is trash and the assets are stolen from the SNES version of Yoshi's Island because I like them.
### License ?
No license since the assets are stolen.  
You can use the code for inspiration, it's pretty bad though.
